Hello! I'm Francisco Calatrava, an electronic engineer turned researcher in the field of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using sensor-based systems. 
My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering, where I developed a keen interest in programming and software development.

During my master's, I specialized in robotics and navigation, focusing primarily on the software aspects. This experience was pivotal, as it steered my 
career towards the integration of software engineering with practical applications in robotics.

In 2020, I joined a Spanish National Project, a pivotal experience in my career. This project allowed me to delve into real-world deployment systems, particularly 
focusing on technologies for elderly care. It was here that I also began to explore the complexities of machine learning, an area that has since become a central part of my research.

Driven by these experiences, I ventured to Europe to seek further research opportunities. My first stop was in France at the University of Technology of Troyes, where I completed an internship under the supervision of Dr. Dimitri Voilmy. Here, I delved into human-robot interaction and human activity recognition, gaining valuable insights and skills.

I then embarked on a PhD journey at Örebro University in Sweden, under the supervision of Oscar Martinez Mozos and Amy Loutfi. After a year of enduring (and secretly enjoying) the mandatory coursework from my program – which I assure you was as thrilling as watching paint dry – I've now plunged into the heart of my research.

My initial exploration began with a classic supervised learning classification problem using deep learning. This exploration sparked a growing interest in the broader aspects of the field. Currently, my research is intensely focused on applying deep learning to human activity recognition. I am particularly intrigued by the challenges posed by the scarcity of annotated data and the issues of inter-person variability in this domain. My work is now geared towards leveraging transfer learning and self-supervised learning techniques to overcome these hurdles.
