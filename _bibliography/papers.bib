ABSTRACT = {The increasingly ageing population and the tendency to live alone have led science and engineering researchers to search for health care solutions. In the COVID 19 pandemic, the elderly have been seriously affected in addition to suffering from isolation and its associated and psychological consequences. This paper provides an overview of the RobWell (Robotic-based Well-Being Monitoring and Coaching System for the Elderly in their Daily Activities) system. It is a system focused on the field of artificial intelligence for mood prediction and coaching. This paper presents a general overview of the initially proposed system as well as the preliminary results related to the home automation subsystem, autonomous robot navigation and mood estimation through machine learning prior to the final system integration, which will be discussed in future works. The main goal is to improve their mental well-being during their daily household activities. The system is composed of ambient intelligence with intelligent sensors, actuators and a robotic platform that interacts with the user. A test smart home system was set up in which the sensors, actuators and robotic platform were integrated and tested. For artificial intelligence applied to mood prediction, we used machine learning to classify several physiological signals into different moods. In robotics, it was concluded that the ROS autonomous navigation stack and its autodocking algorithm were not reliable enough for this task, while the robot’s autonomy was sufficient. Semantic navigation, artificial intelligence and computer vision alternatives are being sought.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents the design of a heterogeneous system aimed at caring for the health and well-being of elderly people living alone at home. It seeks to follow the initiative of the European AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) program. This system consists of a mobile robotic device, a set of low-cost home automation sensors, a medical device like an activity bracelet, and an Android application for studying mood states. The system has been integrated using ROS (Robot Operating System), IoT (Internet of Things) technologies such as Node-RED, and the Home-Assistant home automation platform. This heterogeneous system is currently being developed in a national project called 'Retos de la Sociedad' (Challenges of Society).},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing isolation of the elderly both in their own homes and in care homes has made the problem of caring for elderly people who live alone an urgent priority. This article presents a proposed design for a heterogeneous multirobot system consisting of (i) a small mobile robot to monitor the well-being of elderly people who live alone and suggest activities to keep them positive and active and (ii) a domestic mobile manipulating robot that helps to perform household tasks. The entire system is integrated in an automated home environment (AAL), which also includes a set of low-cost automation sensors, a medical monitoring bracelet and an Android application to propose emotional coaching activities to the person who lives alone. The heterogeneous system uses ROS, IoT technologies, such as Node-RED, and the Home Assistant Platform. Both platforms with the home automation system have been tested over a long period of time and integrated in a real test environment, with good results. The semantic segmentation of the navigation and planning environment in the mobile manipulator for navigation and movement in the manipulation area facilitated the tasks of the later planners. Results about the interactions of users with the applications are presented and the use of artificial intelligence to predict mood is discussed. The experiments support the conclusion that the assistance robot correctly proposes activities, such as calling a relative, exercising, etc., during the day, according to the user&rsquo;s detected emotional state, making this is an innovative proposal aimed at empowering the elderly so that they can be autonomous in their homes and have a good quality of life.},

  abstract =  {This letter addresses the problem of human activity recognition (HAR) of people wearing inertial sensors using data from the UCI-HAR dataset. We propose a light residual network, which obtains an F1-Score of 97.6% that outperforms previous works, while drastically reducing the number of parameters by a factor of 15, and thus the training complexity. In addition, we propose a new benchmark based on leave-one (person)-out cross-validation to standardize and unify future classifications on the same dataset, and to increase reliability and fairness in the comparisons.},
