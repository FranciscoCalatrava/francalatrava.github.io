<p align="justify">This past October, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the IEEE Sensors 2023 Conference, where I presented my work published in the IEEE Sensors Letters Journal. It was an amazing conference, and I thoroughly enjoyed attending as many sessions as I could. The conference offered a multitude of sessions, but unfortunately, they were highly parallel, which meant I had to make careful choices about which ones to attend. As my first experience at an international conference, it was extremely insightful. It not only broadened my understanding but also helped me identify future research directions in the field of Human Activity Recognition.</p>
